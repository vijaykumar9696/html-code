            Acting career
            1978–1981: Early career
            Since his family worshipped Anjaneya, a Hindu deity, his mother advised him to take the screen name "Chiranjeevi", meaning "Immortal", a reference to the belief of Hanuman living forever.[43]
            
            Chiranjeevi started his film career with Punadhirallu.[16] However, his first released film was Pranam Khareedu.[44] Mana Voori Pandavulu, directed by Bapu, gave Chiranjeevi recognition from the Telugu audience.[38] He played a small role in Tayaramma Bangarayya.

In 1979, Chiranjeevi had eight major film releases and then 14 films in the following year.[45][46] He played lead antagonist in works such as Mosagadu, Rani Kasula Rangamma, 47 Natkal /47 Rojulu, Nyayam Kavali and Ranuva Veeran.[47]
            
            1982–1986: Breakthrough with leading roles
            Chiranjeevi began to appear in leading roles with films such as Intlo Ramayya Veedhilo Krishnayya (1982), directed by Kodi Ramakrishna, which was a hit at the box office.[48] Later, he starred in Subhalekha, directed by K. Viswanath, which dealt with the social malady of the dowry system. It brought him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and Viswanath's third Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu.[49][50] He also appeared in movies such as Idi Pellantara, Sitadevi, Tingu Rangadu, Bandhalu Anubandhalu and Mondi Ghatam.

            Khaidi was a box office success and Chiranjeevi attained stardom with this movie.[43] In 1984, he continued doing action films. A series of box office hits at this time include; Mantri Gari Viyyankudu, Sangharshana, Goonda, Challenge, Hero, Donga, Jwala, Adavi Donga, Kondaveeti Raja, Rakshasudu.[52] In 1985, he received his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in Vijetha.[53][54]

            Chiranjeevi received his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for Swayamkrushi (1987), directed by K. Viswanath. Pasivadi Pranam (1987), Yamudiki Mogudu (1988) and Manchi Donga (1988) also did well at the box office. Chiranjeevi co-produced and acted in Rudraveena (1988), which won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration,[23] and the Nandi Special Jury Award. Chiranjeevi then experimented with Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari, a socio-fantasy directed by K. Raghavendra Rao and produced by Ashwini Dutt. Other experimental works at this time include works such as Kondaveeti Donga, the first Telugu film to be released on a 70mm 6-Track Stereophonic sound,[55] the western genre Kodamasimham and the social problem action film Gang Leader (1991), which were box-office hits and led to Chiranjeevi being regarded as the "boss of Telugu cinema".[56]
            
            Chiranjeevi's Bollywood performances were appreciated in Pratibandh[57] and Aaj Ka Goonda Raaj. For his role in Aapadbandhavudu (1992), he received his second Nandi Award for Best Actor and third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. The mid-1990s saw a career dip for Chiranjeevi with box office duds such as S. P. Parasuram, The Gentleman, Big Boss and Rikshavodu. There were exceptions, such as Mutha Mestri, which fetched him a fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; Mugguru Monagallu and Alluda Majaka were also successful.[54] In 1996, he appeared in a guest role in the Kannada film Sipayi. After a brief lull, Chiranjeevi bounced back with Hitler, Master, Bavagaru Bagunnara?, Choodalani Vundi and Sneham Kosam, for which he received his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.

            Chiranjeevi's new decade started with Annayya. After a brief gap, Chiranjeevi starred in Indra, released in 2002, which broke all his previous box office records of Tollywood and won him his third Nandi Award for Best Actor and sixth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. After that, he appeared in films with an underlying message and a social cause, including Tagore; Shankar Dada M.B.B.S., for which he won his seventh and latest Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; and Stalin. He was awarded the Filmfare Special Award – South in 2006 and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in 2011 for his contributions to the film industry.[59]

            Following his last film in the lead role, 2007's Shankar Dada Zindabad, Chiranjeevi did not star in any film for approximately 10 years, during which he embarked on his political career. During these 10 years, his appearances in films were limited to cameo roles. He appeared as himself in two films, starring his son Ram Charan, namely Magadheera (2009) and Bruce Lee: The Fighter (2015). He also narrated Varudu (2010) and Rudhramadevi (2015).
            
            2017–present: Comeback
            From 2013 onwards, he was on the lookout for the right script to mark his comeback into cinema, in what would coincidentally happen to be his 150th film as an actor. A year following the release of the highly successful 2014 Tamil film Kaththi, Chiranjeevi chose to remake that film in Telugu as his comeback film. The remake, titled Khaidi No. 150, directed by V. V. Vinayak, was released during the Sankranti holiday in 2017, about six months short of a decade following Shankar Dada Zindabad, to positive reviews. Critics have singled out Chiranjeevi in particular, praising him for both his performance and appearance, especially following a decade of absence from cinema.[60][61] The movie collected ₹ 41.75 crore on its opening day[62] and grossed ₹ 164 crore in its lifetime.[63] In 2019, he starred in his first period film Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy based on the life of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy; it was directed by Surender Reddy. The movie made on a budget more than ₹ 270 crore,[64] grossed more than ₹240 crore (equivalent to ₹337 crore or US$40 million in 2023) in its theatrical run.[65]
            
            Chiranjeevi had two releases in 2022. His first film was Acharya directed by Koratala Siva co-starring Chiranjeevi’s son Ram Charan. His second release was GodFather directed by Mohan Raja. The film had Salman Khan in an extended cameo role and was largely successful. GodFather subsequently released on Netflix.[66]
            
            Chiranjeevi then starred in the 2023 film Waltair Veerayya directed by Bobby Kolli which released during the Sankranti festival. The film also starred Ravi Teja in an important role, reuniting them on screen after 23 years since the 2000 film Annayya. The film met huge commercial success. Waltair Veerayya later released on Netflix for streaming.[67] In the same year, he also appeared in Bhola Shankar, a remake of the 2015 Tamil blockbuster, Vedalam. However, it opened to unanimously negative reviews and was a huge disaster at the box-office.[68]
            
            He announced his next film, Vishwambhara (2025), with Mallidi Vassishta of Bimbisara (2022) fame.</p>

            <p>Chiranjeevi made his debut as a Television host with the fourth season of Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu. The first episode of the fourth season was aired on 13 February 2017 on Star Maa. The game show is a Telugu-language adaptation of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.[70]
    
                Political career
                In August 2008, Chiranjeevi launched his political party, Praja Rajyam Party, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh.[71] At the launch, he stated that social justice was the main agenda of his party.[72] In the 2009 general elections, the party won 18 of the 294 seats in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly.[73] He contested from both Tirupati and Palakollu constituencies winning in Tirupati but losing out in Palakollu, in West Godavari district.[74][75][76]
                
                
                Chiranjeevi taking charge as the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Tourism, in New Delhi in 2012
                On 6 February 2011, Chiranjeevi merged the 30-month-old Praja Rajyam Party with the Indian National Congress,[73][77] after two weeks of talks with Sonia Gandhi, the president of Congress, feared the no-confidence motion in the state assembly in the wake of the emergence of Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSR Congress Party and the stronghold of Telangana agitation. More than one year after merging his party into Congress, he was nominated to Rajya Sabha on 29 March 2012; he was elected and took the oath as a Rajya Sabha member on 3 April, and was sworn in as the Union Minister of State (Independent charge), Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, on 28 October 2012.[78] In 2013, he inaugurated the Incredible India Exhibition, a joint participation of the Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting at the 66th Cannes Film Festival.[79][80] In 2013, Chiranjeevi represented Incredible India at the 14th International Indian Film Academy Awards ceremony held in Macau.[81]
                
                After the split of the state of Andhra Pradesh leaving the residuary state with huge debt and little revenue in June 2014, most members of the Andhra Pradesh wing of Congress party left in protest.[82] Chiranjeevi, however, remained with Congress and campaigned for it as chairman of Election Campaign Committee for 2014 parliamentary and assembly elections in the residual state of Andhra Pradesh. However, he refrained from contesting in elections.[83] There was also speculation that he did not campaign wholeheartedly due to the one-sided decision taken to split Andhra Pradesh.[84][85][86] His younger brother, Pawan Kalyan, a former Praja Rajyam Party youth wing leader, launched his own political party, Jana Sena Party, and campaigned vigorously against Congress and in favour of Telugu Desam Party and Bharatiya Janata Party.[87] Due to the strong anti-Congress sentiment prevailing in Andhra Pradesh, its candidates were defeated in all parliamentary and state assembly seats of Andhra Pradesh.[88][89]
                
                Since the 2014 elections, he has stayed away from active politics and since then, has not attended any meetings of the Congress party, on a regional or national level. His tenure as a Rajya Sabha member ended in April 2018.[90] Although he is currently not active in politics, he was issued with a new All India Congress Committee identity card in 2022 leading to the speculation of his political comeback.[91][92][93]

                On 2 October 1998, he founded the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust (CCT), which includes Chiranjeevi Blood and Eye Banks. It is the state's largest recipient of blood and eye donations. The trust has made over 68,000 blood donations and 1,414 eye donations.[16][94][95] The blood bank of the CCT has helped over 80,000 people and the eye bank has helped about 1,000 people in the state of Andhra Pradesh since its opening. Around 350,000 people have pledged their eyes to CCT so far, giving 1600 people eyesight through CCT. CCT has also won the "Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award" by the AP State Government for the past four years.[96][97] On 10 June 2006, the then President of India, Abdul Kalam, inaugurated the Chiranjeevi Charitable Foundation (CCF) at Jubilee Hills Check Post in Hyderabad.[98]
